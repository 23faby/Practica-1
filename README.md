[![Build Status]][Appveyor]

[中文说明]

#### Features

1. System proxy configuration
2. PAC mode and global mode
3. [GFWList] and user rules
4. Supports HTTP proxy
5. Supports server auto switching
6. Supports UDP relay (see Usage)

#### Download

Download the latest release from [release page].

#### Requirements

Microsoft [.NET Framework 4.7.2] or higher, Microsoft [Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable] (x86) .

#### Basic

1. Find Shadowsocks icon in the notification tray
2. You can add multiple servers in servers menu
3. Select `Enable System Proxy` menu to enable system proxy. Please disable other
proxy addons in your browser, or set them to use system proxy
4. You can also configure your browser proxy manually if you don't want to enable
system proxy. Set Socks5 or HTTP proxy to 127.0.0.1:1080. You can change this
port in `Servers -> Edit Servers`

#### PAC

1. You can change PAC rules by editing the PAC file. When you save the PAC file
with any editor, Shadowsocks will notify browsers about the change automatically
2. You can also update PAC file from [GFWList] \(maintained by 3rd party)
3. You can also use online PAC URL

For Windows10 Store and related applications, please execute the following command under Admin privilege:
```
netsh winhttp import proxy source=ie
```

#### Server Auto Switching

1. Load balance: choosing server randomly
2. High availability: choosing the best server (low latency and packet loss)
3. Choose By Total Package Loss: ping and choose. Please also enable
   `Availability Statistics` in the menu if you want to use this
4. Write your own strategy by implement IStrategy interface and send us a pull request!

#### UDP

For UDP, you need to use SocksCap or ProxyCap to force programs you want
to be proxied to tunnel over Shadowsocks

#### Multiple Instances

If you want to manage multiple servers using other tools like SwitchyOmega,
you can start multiple Shadowsocks instances. To avoid configuration conflicts,
copy Shadowsocks to a new directory and choose a different local port.

#### Plugins

If you would like to connect to server via a plugin, please set the plugin's
path (relative or absolute) on Edit Servers form.
_Note_: Forward Proxy will not be used while a plugin is enabled.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
